# Introduction #

**FastRecovery** is a application which is part of the PRO CFW Project.

Its sole purpose lies in performing a QuickStart to boot a OFW into a CFW environment for extended functionality.

# Details #

To perform a QuickStart, a existing installation of the [Aftermarket Modules](AftermarketModules.md) on flash0 is required.

# Functionality #

FastRecovery overrides the [Reboot Sector](RebootSector.md) in memory via a combination of Kernel Exploits. This replaced / patched [Reboot Sector](RebootSector.md) in turn circumvents further security levels to allow the [Aftermarket Modules](AftermarketModules.md) to get executed.
