Introduction

FastRecovery is a application which is part of the PRO CFW Project.

Its sole purpose lies in performing a QuickStart to boot a OFW into a CFW environment for extended functionality.
Details

To perform a QuickStart, a existing installation of the Aftermarket Modules on flash0 is required.
Functionality

FastRecovery overrides the Reboot Sector in memory via a combination of Kernel Exploits. This replaced / patched Reboot Sector in turn circumvents further security levels to allow the Aftermarket Modules to get executed.
