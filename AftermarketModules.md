# Introduction #

The **Aftermarket Modules** are part of the PRO CFW Project.

Their purpose lies in patching and extending the system modules to provide the enduser with a richer set of features.

# Functionality #

Most of the work done by the Aftermarket Modules lies in properly hooking and patching loose ends aswell as disabling system security to allow proper execution of custom content.

They are split into several supporting libraries, distributing tasks to multiple small modules to provide modularity and most effective use of system memory.
